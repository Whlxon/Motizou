<h1>Hello and welcome to Motizou!</h1>
<h2>Motizou is always with you! ^^</h2>

Motizou is an educational app for children ages 7 to 12 who don't speak French. I created this app for personal use, but if you're interested, we can discuss making it accessible.

I developed this app entirely in TypeScript with the React Framework and Vite. I'm learning this at school, so if something isn't perfect, that's normal, well... nobody's perfect! ^^

So welcome to Motizou and enjoy your visit!
